      Prototypes, feared by many, dominated by a few.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Even with all the hype that many of us OOP programmers out there trying
      to get our ways, and implement our beloved patterns, it seems difficult
      even to use the most simple features of JavaScript along this paradigm.
    </p>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    <p>
      Don't worry, I understand.
    </p>

      But when dark times come, these usually bring people that have experienced
      some sort of this cloudy and shadow neighborhoods that make us tremble when
      the project manager says:
    </p>

    <p class="dialog">
        "Hey, we are getting some issues in the product page,
        would you mind taking a look at it?"
    </p>

    <p class="sneaky-action">
        * project manager flees and leaves you to die*
    </p>

    <p>
      So, let's get started for once.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      Prototypes pretty much work the same way as object instances in <span id="code-tag-1" class="code">Java/C#/PHP</span> do.
    </p>
    <p>
      You add a few "methods" to have some functionality or behavior going, and you're good to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things get fuzzy when we attempt to mess with the word <span id="code-tag-2" class="code">this</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, to wrap our heads around this, we must run into some
      samples so we can put our terms over the table and actually
      see what's going on:
    </p>
    <h3>ES5</h3>
    <div class="code-section">
        <input type="checkbox" class="collapse-checkbox" id="collapse-1">
        <label class="collapse-toggle" for="collapse-1">
        </label>
        <pre class="collapse-content">
        <code class="code language-javascript">
          function Person(name){
            this.name = name
            this.sayHi = function() {
              console.log("Hi! I'm " + this.name)
            }
          }
  
          var johnSmith = new Person()
          johnSmith.sayHi()
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <h3>ES6</h3>
    <div class="code-section">
        <input type="checkbox" class="collapse-checkbox" id="collapse-2">
        <label class="collapse-toggle" for="collapse-2">
        </label>
        <pre class="collapse-content">
        <code class="code language-javascript">
          class Person {
            constructor(name) {
              this.name = name
            }

            sayHi() {
              console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}`)
            }
          }

          const johnSmith = new Person()
            johnSmith.sayHi()
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
