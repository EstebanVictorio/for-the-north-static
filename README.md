# for-the-north
A JavaScript-related blog. From me, and my experiences.



### Hello!

This is a repository dedicated only to the people that want to know about JavaScript and do not know to start.

Lessons posted here, I hope, will help those with a similar perspective about it and will take their knowledge to
the next level.
